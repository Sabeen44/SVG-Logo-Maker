# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Overview

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a simple logo. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo and saves it as an SVG file.

## Functionality

The code makes use of javascript class and inheritance. A parent Shape class holds a common functionality shared by the individual shapes (triangle,square cirlce) classes.
That allows each shape class to inherit the code from the parent class.
To test if correct shapes are going to be rendered, each class of shape is tested using Jest.

## Technologies Used

This project is powered by Node.js v16, utilizes inquirer v8.2.4 (node package manager), and file system module (node package manager). It also employs jest v29.5.0 (node package manager) for the unit testing conducted in this application.

## Installation

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/Sabeen44/SVG-Logo-Maker.git and open in a code editor (such as VS Code).

Using the terminal, install node.js v16. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies, inquirere and jest. Run npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer, and npm i jest to install the latest version of jest.
